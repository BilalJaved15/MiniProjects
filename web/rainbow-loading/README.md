# Rainbow Loading Bar

## USAGE

To use this in your project, include this script,

```html
<scriptÂ src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/faatehsultan/MiniProjects/web/rainbow-loading/api.js"></script>
```

After that, create an element ``` .rainbow-loading-container ``` class as:

```html
<divÂ class="rainbow-loading-container"></div>
```

Finally, call this method to trigger loading,

```javascript
startLoadingBar(20, "Awesome Loading!");
```

It recieves two optional arguments. First is duration (default 10s) and second is heading text (default is "L o a d i n g . . .").
